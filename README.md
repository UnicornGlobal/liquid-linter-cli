This package is a wrapper for the NodeJs [liquid-linter][liquid-linter] package,
allowing it to be run from the command-line interface (CLI).

## Installation

Install this package with [NPM][NPM] using `npm install liquid-linter-cli --save`
(optionally adding `--global` for a system-wide install) or with [Yarn][Yarn]
using `yarn add liquid-linter-cli` (or `yarn global add liquid-linter-cli` for a
system-wide install).

## Usage

The lint command can be called with one or more paths of files or folders that
need to be linted. The command has support for [pipelines][pipelines]. when
given a directory, it is scanned for the following file extensions:

- `.htm`
- `.html`
- `.liquid`
- `.lqd`
- `.markdown`
- `.md`

Currently the linter does not have a way to _exclude_ files or folders. An
example of how to achieve this is given in the "Pipes" section.

### Simple usage

The most simple use is simply:

```bash
liquid-linter /path/to/directory/or/file/to/lint
```

### Multiple sources

The lint command has support for multiple paths. This can be a mix of files and
folders:

```bash
liquid-linter /path/to/directory/one /path/to/file /path/to/directory/two
```

### Custom blocks and tags

Liquid has support for custom [tags][liquid-tags]. The liquid-linter makes the
distinction between **tags** (tags that _do not_ require an end tag) and
**blocks** (tags that _do_ require an end tag).

Custom tags and blocks can be passed to the linter using the `--custom-tag` and
`--custom-block` flags, respectively. Both can be added multiple times, to add
more than one tag or block:

```bash
liquid-linter --custom-block section --custom-tag button --custom-tag color /path/to/directory
```

### Piping

In order to _exclude_ files and folder, the user has to create a list themselves
which does not contain the files and/or folders that should be excluded.

One way to achieve this is by using a combination of [`find`][gnu-find] and [`xargs`][gnu-xargs].

The following example shows how to lint all files and folders in the current
directory except the `node_modules` and `_site` folders, and only for files with
the `.lqd` extension (commonly used for [includes][includes])

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.lqd"     \
  -not -path './node_modules/*'  \
  -not -path './_site/*' -print0 \
| xargs -0 -n1 liquid-linter
```

### Output

The output of the linter displays a list of files and the result of the linting
of that file. Files with no issues are colored green, files with issues are
colored red.

For files with issues, the line and column(s) at which the error occurred are
show.

#### Example

The output is taken _directly_ from [liquid-linter]. Any weird output or
incorrect linting should be reported at the [liquid-lint repository].
